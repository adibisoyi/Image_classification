### Description
The **Image Classification** repository demonstrates different techniques to classify images into predefined categories. The project includes:
- **Custom CNN Model**: A model built from scratch to classify images.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pretrained models like MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 to improve performance on classification tasks.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting feature vectors from images using pretrained models, which can be used for tasks like similarity search.

### Features
- **Custom Model Implementation**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch.
- **Transfer Learning**: Includes examples of how to apply transfer learning using pretrained models.
- **Feature Extraction with Pretrained Models**: Demonstrates extracting features with MobileNetV2.
- **Colab-Ready**: The code and notebooks are optimized for use in Google Colab with GPU support.

### Setup

#### Requirements
- **Python** 3.8+
- **TensorFlow** 2.x
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**
- **NumPy**, **Pillow** for image processing

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
```
### Usage
**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image_classification.git
cd Image_classification
```
**Open the Notebooks**
- Use ImageClassification.ipynb to build and train a custom image classification model.
